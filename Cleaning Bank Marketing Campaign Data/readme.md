<h1>**Personal Loan Marketing Campaign Data Cleaning Project**</h1>

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing data collected from a bank's recent marketing campaign, which aimed to encourage customers to take out personal loans. Personal loans are a significant revenue stream for banks, with interest rates for two-year loans in the United Kingdom averaging around 10%. In September 2022 alone, UK consumers borrowed approximately £1.5 billion, generating an estimated £300 million in interest over two years.
