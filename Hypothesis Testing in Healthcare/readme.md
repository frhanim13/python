<h1>Hypothesis Testing in Healthcare: Drug Safety</h1>

The dataset drug_safety.csv was obtained from Hbiostat courtesy of the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics. It contained five adverse effects: headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, upper respiratory infection, chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), demographic data, vital signs, lab measures, etc. The ratio of drug observations to placebo observations is 2 to 1.

<h1>Goals </h1>

1)Determine if the proportion of adverse effects differs significantly between the Drug and Placebo groups, saving the p-value as a variable called two_sample_p_value.

2)Find out if the number of adverse effects is independent of the treatment and control groups, saving as a variable called num_effects_p_value containing a p-value.

3)Examine if there is a significant difference between the ages of the Drug and Placebo groups, storing the p-value of your test in a variable called age_group_effects_p_value.
